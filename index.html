                    <p>Commonly referred to as earth or dirt, though some may argue one of those. Did you know you are more likely to get tetanus from soil than the jagged rusted metals we wary of. A smart woman told me this, but I still looked it up. She is still right. She is not dead.</p>

                    <h2>Dirt</h2>
                    <p>How does a scientific definition distinguish dirt from soil, Wikipedia? How does it restrict dirt to displacement. When I turn the earth in preparation for a new year&apos;s garden, when I move that earth to a place in need, is that discplacement? I thought I was doing something good.</p>

                    <h2>Displacement</h2>
                    <p>Displacement can be calculated. It&apos;s a matter of geometry. It is also a matter of physics. When it is a function, it tells us how far the atom has fallen. I don&apos;t need to tell you about how your unhappiness becomes my unhappiness. I don&apos;t need to tell you about war and persecution and natural disaster.</p>

                    <h2>Burial</h2>
                    <p>Intentional burial is old. It is spiritual, not just religous. Wikipedia offers &quot;Reasons for human burial.&quot; But this reason is applied after the fact. For thousands of years, we have returned our dead to the earth. For thousands of years, we understood gravity without reason.</p>
